sensors:
  # hwmon: Full path to a temperature file (single sensor).
  # =======================================================
  # Disadvantage is that the index in "hwmon0" depends on the load order of
  # the driver modules, which may change across bootups on some systems.
  - hwmon: /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp


  # tpacpi: Legacy interface to the thinkpad_acpi driver
  # ====================================================
  # Particularly on older Thinkpad laptops, this interface may give access to
  # 8-16 temperature sensors, but it may be hard to tell where/what exactly
  # they measure.
  # Some documentation for older models may be found at the thinkpad wiki:
  # https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors
  #
  # Note that the hwmon interface is to be preferred nowadays.
  # - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal
    # Some of the temperature entries in /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal may be
    # irrelevant or unused, so individual ones can be selected:
    # indices: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Fan Drivers
# ===========
#
# Currently, thinkfan supports only one fan, but support for multiple fans is
# in development and will be released soon. For the time being, the examples
# given below are mutually exclusive.

fans:

  # tpacpi: Thinkpad-specific fan interface
  # =======================================
  # Currently, this is the only way to use disengaged and automatic mode on
  # thinkpads.

# Fan Speeds (simple mode)
# ========================
# 
# In simple mode, each entry is a [FANSPEED, LOWER_LIMIT, UPPER_LIMIT] tuple.
# This is a quick way to configure a small system like a laptop, where the
# temperature ratings for all monitored devices are similar. Only the highest
# temperature found across all sensors will be compared against these limits.
# All other temperatures are ignored.
#
# Correction values on individual sensors (see above) may be used to equalize
# small discrepancies in temperature ratings.
#
# The FANSPEED values in this example are valid for the thinkpad_acpi fan
# driver only (see above)
